CS478 Computational Geometry Term Project

The program generates a set of random points in two dimensions using various distributions as input and visualizes the 2D Voronoi Diagram as graphical output. The program allows the users to specify parameters such as the number of points and the distribution type. It also includes features such as zooming in/out and translation while displaying the 2D Voronoi Diagram.
